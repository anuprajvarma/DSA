## What is DSA?
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.

## Advantages and Real Use of Data Structure In Domain Name Structure
•	DS allow into storage on hard disk <br />
•	It manages large data <br />
•	It is necessary for designing of efficient algorithm <br />

## What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task <br />

## Efficiency Analysis Of Algorithms

  we can compare the performanece of algorithms by using following factors <br />
  
    . space complexity 
    . time complexity 
    
    - space complexity
          the term space complexity represents the mount of memory space needed the algorithm in its life cycle
          
    - time complexity
          the term time complexity represents of a program is the amount of computer time it needs to run a program to completion
          
          . we can divide the time complexity on three catogories
            1. best case
            2. worst case
            3. average case

## 1. Linear Data Structure
  In the linear data structures data can be processed one by one i.e sequentially <br />
  
  The linear data structures are <br />
    - array <br />
    - linked list <br />
    - stack <br />
    - queue <br />
    
    • arrays
    
      array is a collectiona of homogeneous data elements i.e it can store same type of data value 
      
      advantages :- 
      
      * random access 
      * very fast access if it index known 
      
      dis-advantages :- 
      
      * fixed size
      * store same type of data
      
      types of arrays
      
      - one dimensional array
      - two dimensional array
      - multi dimensional array
      
<br />
      
      • linked list
      
        linked list is a linear data structure
        the linked list is a linear collections of data items called as nodes
        
        the node is divided into two fields
        
            > data field
            > link field (link to another node)
            
        types of linked list
        
          - single linked list
          - doubly linked list
          - circular linked list
          
 ## 2. Non-linear data strcture
   in non-linear data strcture the elements do not form a sequence <br />
   we cant access the data on sequentially <br />
   
   the non-linear data structures are :- <br />
    - trees <br />
    - graphs <br />
      
      • trees
          tree is a finite set of nodes, that is specially designated node is called root and remaining nodes are collections of sub trees
      
      • graphs
          graphs is a collection of non-empty nonlinear set of nodes and set of edges
          
          
 ## Common Operations on Data Strctures : <br />
   * Insertion : adding the new elements to existing data strcture
   * Deletion  : deleting the element from a data structure
   * Traversing : access the each elements
   * Searching : searching a particular element on a particuar data structure
   * Sorting : arramging the elements either ascending or descending order
   * Merging : combine two different program element into single sorted file
